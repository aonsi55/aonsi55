# Hi there, I'm Ali Onsi 👋

### Scientific Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer | Ph.D. Physicist

I am a **"Full-Cycle" Problem Solver** who bridges the gap between deep scientific research and production-grade software. 

While most developers can only write code and most researchers can only analyze data, I do both. I use **Python** to model complex physical systems, **React & Flask** to build user-friendly applications, and **Docker** to deploy them to the real world.
