âš¡ My Quote ''*The world we perceive is not as it is, but as our minds reconstruct it. The inverted image on the retina is effortlessly corrected, yet this reveals a deeper mystery; how many other distortions, illusions, and assumptions has our mind silently 'fixed' for us? What if our greatest deception is not in what we fail to see, but in what we believe we see clearly? Wisdom begins when we question the very lens through which we perceive truth.*''
